## Project thoughts

How does the amount of time students spend on social activities connect to their academic performance? 

Given that students have limited time resources and that more social engagement may result in less time available for studying and finishing assignments, I hypothesize that increasing time spent on social activities is adversely correlated with GPA. Weekly hours spent on social activities, as determined by how many hours students report spending with friends, going to events, or being involved in social organizations, is the main explanatory variable. It is possible to make meaningful comparisons because this variable differs among pupils. Student GPA, which measures academic performance on a conventional 0–4 scale, is the outcome variable. In a regression analysis, evidence for my hypothesis would show a negative association between social hours and GPA, indicating that GPA tends to decline as social time increases. On the other hand, the hypothesis would be refuted if the data showed no correlation or a positive association, meaning that students who interact more also have equal or higher GPAs. This would imply that social involvement does not negatively impact academic performance and may even promote it.
